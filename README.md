# What is this?

This is a table top role playing system that focusses on the story-telling aspects of the game by having a slim set of rules.

- There is no technical side of character creation (No assigning attributes, rolling for stats or proficiencies).
- Combat moves quickly (you can move and you can act)
- Changing time periods just means creating weapons and items for your use case

# About this document

There are three sections to this document, Attributes, Combat, and Guideline Tables. The Attributes section contains info on character creation, leveling, how to roll for things, and how to use items. The Combat section extends the attributes section to allow for turn-based narration. As the most common turn-based narration is a fight scene, this section is labeled Combat. It dives into attacking, defending, and what it looks like to die. Extension of the Combat system to include other turn-based narration scenarios is welcome. Last is the Guideline Tables. These tables provide characters and players with standards for how the game can be utilized.

All that is needed to start playing is someone to play the roll of the Universe (the player playing the Universe is hereafter reffered to as "Universe") and one or more people to play a set of characters living in the universe.

# Attributes

There are three centers of intelligence - body, mind, and social. Each center governs how well a character will interact with their surroundings in the various situations they may come across.

The centers are split into:
- "strength" - how well a character can effect the world through that center and 
- "awareness" - how well a character can perceive the world through that center.

## Attribute descriptions

- Body Strength: A traditional view of "strength." How much mass a character can move, how much force they can hit with, etc.
- Body Awareness: Agility. How accurately a character can move and contort their body to perform various actions
- Social Strength: Speech Giving, Pursuassion, Bartering. How well a character can communicate thoughts and emotions to another and influence that person's decisions.
- Social Awareness: Empathy, Sympathy, Insight. How well a character can perceive others' intentions, actions, words, and how the character is being perceived.
- Mental Strength: Puzzling, Cartography, Navigation, Deciphering. How well a character can reason about things.
- Mental Awareness: Sensing, Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Researching. How well a character can gather information from the outside world.

## Attribute Shorthand

It can get tedious writing out all characters of each attribute every time they are used. Instead, we combine the first letter of the attribute and the first letter of the dimension.

- Body Strength: BS
- Body Awareness: BA
- Social Strength: SS
- Social Awareness: SA
- Mental Strength: MS
- Mental Awareness: MA

## Using Attributes

There are two major ways to use these attributes.

1. Straight Attribute Roll

This is analogous to the common concept of a "dexterity saving throw." When a situation occurs where characters need to react to something in a straight forward manner, you set the difficulty and ask players to roll OVER the number you set (you don't necessarily have to tell them what the difficulty is). A player rolls that number and adds their attribute to that roll.

Use the [probability tool](https://winstonpuckett.com/products/probability) to determine how likely it is a player will succeed.

2. Skill Roll

*See the skill table below for a list of skills*

There are often times when your players will attempt something with a more nuanced skill set necessary. In these circumstances, you can ask players to make a roll using whatever combination of attributes you prefer.

There are many common skills in games - cooking, sneaking, melee attacks, and ranged attacks for instance which it may be helpful to pre-calculate. These are listed in the skill table below so that your players don't have to do math repetitively.

### Guidelines in using attributes (for Universe beginners)

### Not rolling for things the characters already figure out.

It may be tempting to hand your players a puzzle, then have them roll MS to figure out how to solve it. Sometimes dumb characters make smart moves. If a player finds the answer, they should be allowed to progress the story. Especially if they can find a way for the solution to fit into the character they are playing.

It might also be tempting to have players roll for persuassion. This is more acceptable, but needs to be done in the right context. Sometimes your players make a brilliant speech - their characters should be able to say those words. When you roll for social strength, have it be about whether that was the right thing to say to that person. Maybe they made a really intimidating speech, but their character is wearing clothes which don't make it very intimidating coming out of their mouth. Maybe they said something really wise to convince George to stay, but they used the same words George's wife used right before she walked out on him.

In general, these attributes never alter the player's actions for their character - only the outcomes.

### Ask players to roll first before narration

Especially in social settings, having your players roll before their characters speak can give insight into how they should play out the scene. Taking the pursuassion example above, instead of trying to explain why a brilliant speech fell on deaf ears, ask the player to roll for pursuassion. If they roll low, the player can voluntarily contribute a shody speech which falls easily into the narration of the story.

### Not rolling for everything

Make your players roll for things they care about. It may not be a roll to cook for your camp tonight, but if you're in town cooking rations, it might be exciting to roll for how many rations you can make before you'll have to return to town.

Every roll should mean something. Listen to your players for whether this roll will have an impact on their experience at the table.

## Items

Items such as daggers, armor, spy glasses are represented on cards. These cards contain all rules for how to use that item including how many limbs that item takes up, its intended purpose, attribute requirements, etc. 

Your character must meet all requirements in order to use the item effectively. If your character does not meet all requirements, the Universe may decide how the item applies. For instance:
- Your character doesn't meet the BA requirements, so the Universe decides that on a fail of 4 or more, your character deals damage to themselves instead of the opponent. 
- Perhaps your character attempts to use two spears at once (which would require four hands). In this case, you have + 1 damage when you hit, but -4 chance to hit.
- Maybe your character attempts to wear two sets of armour at one time. You're asked to role a D20. On anything below 10, the second set of armour is damaged. 10-19, it's simply impossible to get it on. On a 20, you can wear both sets of armour at once, but you have to have the BA necessary or you can't move at all.

Here's an example item:

```
Assassin's Dagger:

Requirements:
- One hand
- BA: 2
- MA: 3

Melee Attack Damage: 1 D12 + 1
Ranged Attack Damage: 2 D8
```

```
Chainmail Armour:

Requirements:
- Covers full body except head, feet, hands.
- BA: 1

AC: +2
Sneak: -2
```

## An aside on classes and races

The first time I played a classless, raceless system I was shocked by how excellent it was to focus on those as story telling elements instead of elements that effect stats.

In playing Cairn, I was an outlaw named Loop. Because there were no special abilities associated with that background, I focussed on playing out the intentions of an outlaw being in a band of people out to rescue the king's son. Upon meeting another rescue party, I attempted to rob them while they were sleeping. The adventuring party laughed as I looted dead bodies smelling strongly of vommit. The experience was different for the group *because* I was an outlaw. When I've played rogues in the past, I have tended to stick to lawful good - focussing on skillset. This was a much more full role playing experience

In playing Vaeson, I was a fey changling named Chad Chadbourne. I was part of a monster hunting group that hunted all sorts of dark creatures - including the fey. Playing out hiding my identity from the rest of the party and eternally searching for my heritage (my reason to join the hunting group) was incredibly rewarding. I normally play fey/elf/spiritually-in-tune creatures when I play a TTRPG, but this was the first time that my background played into how I interacted with the world. All without a focus on "choosing an elf cause it gives me better dexterity."

In both of these scenarios, the class and race drew me further in to playing out the character. Your character should have a rich background. That background should be central to how you play out your character, not a means to a better attribute.

As an aside to this aside, associating races and attributes does not translate well beyond a fantasy world of elves and dwarves. That, however, is a discussion for another day.

## Creating a character

There's nothing needed for character creation

Technically, characters don't even need names to start out. Everyone starts at 0 for their attributes. This enables new players to get a feel for what sort of attributes they use most often. Then when they level, they have more awareness of what happens. However, for any sort of campaign, it is beneficial to list out a couple of things to drive the player toward certain actions.

Here are some dimensions to give characters depth:
- Name
- Purpose in joining up with the party
- Greatest desire / fear
- Profession
- Background
- Family life / childhood
- Unique characteristics / quirks
- Demeanor
- Height / Weight / Age / Gender
- Species (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Orc, Kobold, Zombie with a dead rat, etc.)

These dimensions should drive decisions around starting equipment. Work with your Universe to find out what would be reasonable for your character to start with.

These dimensions could also help people 

## Leveling

The Universe chooses when characters level up. This system does not impose XP or milestone based leveling - believing that the right choice differs per campaign. If this is your first campaign as Universe, I recommend milestone based leveling (characters level up at the end of each session).

When a character levels up, they permanently add 1 to an attribute of their choosing.

# Combat

## Taking a turn

Every character roles for initiative (Initiative skill + D20). Players take turns in order of initiative from highest to lowest. In the case of a tie, the side that started the combat goes first.

Once turn order is established, each character can move up to their full movement (normally 5 spaces [25 feet]) and take an action. Theoretically, turns should be 5 seconds long.

### Attacking

Roll `3D6 + either melee or ranged attack modifier`. If that number is **over** the target's AC, roll damage.

Damage:
- Unarmed attacks are `1D4 + BS`
- Attacks using an item as intended use the item's damage (Ex: Shooting an arrow from a bow does the bow's damage)
- When a character attacks using an item unconventionally, the Universe decides how the weapon will deal damage. The "Standard Items" table can be used to guide the decision.

### Doing something other than attacking

You are not restricted to attacks. You can also:

- Dodge: Give the first attack against your character disadvantage.
- Dash: Take up to your character's full movement again.
- Stabilize Target: See *Stabilization* below.
- Anything else that your character could do within 5 second.
- Start doing something that will take more than 5 seconds.

## Defending

If an opponent rolls over your AC, they deal damage to your HP. Note your character's current HP. 

> Note: When you are dealt damage which makes you fall at or below 0, write down the actual amount it fell below 0. 

- If your character's HP reaches 0, they are considered "Unconcious." Unconcious characters cannot move or take actions. 
- If their HP reaches -3, the character is considered "Bleeding out." Each round a character is Bleeding out, they lose 1 HP.
- If a character reaches -10 HP, they are considered dead. Dead characters cannot be revived.

These rules mean that it is possible to kill a character in one hit. For instance, if Samantha the Wizard has 2 HP and an opponent deals 12 damage, Samantha the Wizard dies.

### Stabilization

Any concious character can take an action to stabilize a being that is bleeding out. To do so, the player rolls 3D6. If they roll higher than `7 + Number of Negative hitpoints target has acquired`, the target stops losing hitpoints after every round.

## Resting

Characters may regain HP by resting. To rest, characters need to reasonably believe that they will be safe for the next 8 hours. All players, including the Universe, need to agree that the characters would be able to rest. If all characters choose to rest in an unsafe space and wandering monsters engage the party, every monster gets to take a turn before the players can react.

# Guideline Tables

> Note: These tables may be altered by the Universe. Feel free to ask them if they are using these tables.

## Skills

Skills are common combinations of attributes that would be useful to have around. Below is a list of all skills plus their attribute combinations. Instead of recalculating this, just go to the character maker (TODO) and plug in your character's attributes.
