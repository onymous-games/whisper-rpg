# What is this?

Twin-triad is an extensible table-top roleplaying system that focuses on storytelling and new player accessibility. It is built to be built upon, which means that it can easily serve as the basis for other role playing systems.

## About extensibility

Often the breadth of role-playing systems encourages experienced world builders to start from scratch and build a new system for their setting. Creating these systems is incredibly fun but can be tedious and time consuming.

Twin-triad meets the need of world makers to reduce tedium and allow focus on the important bits: the uniqueness and intrigue of your world.

## About storytelling

The ethos of twin-triad is to distill the ruleset into something so digestible that the rules can get out of the way of the story. Everyone at the table should understand the impact of everyone else's actions.

By minimizing the flashiness of the official rules, it encourages experimentation from players. "What happens if I drop a candle on the ice warrior instead of attacking with my mace?" "Can this drawbridge be raised before the zombies get in? Are they stupid enough to run into the pit of alligators? Will that make zombie alligators?" These are just some of the questions I'd like to encourage.

## About new player accessibility

Unless agreed otherwise, no characters must roll for their stats. There's no rolling for starting equipment. The only thing you need to decide is your character's name.

I thought of this when I played a campaign with a number of people who had never engaged in a role-playing game before. They chose classes and races that ultimately disapointed them later. For instance, a player's orc barbarian kept deciding to having delicate arguments with people yet had no social grace. Had they had experience, they may have chosen something else.

Expecting inexperienced players to take on roles for an entire campaign before they understand their choices is an unfair ask. Instead, twin-triad is built such that you decide skills after you've started using them.

## About this document

There are three sections to this document, Attributes, Combat, and Skills. The Attributes section holds info on character creation, leveling, how to roll for things, and how to use items. The Combat section extends the attributes section to allow for turn-based narration. As the most common turn-based narration is a fight scene, this section is labeled Combat. It dives into attacking, defending, and what it looks like to die. Extension of the Combat system to include other turn-based narration scenarios is welcome. Last are the Skills. These are common sets of rolls that a player may make during a game. It's useful to have these written down so that the Universe doesn't have to figure out how to make people roll for something every time it happens.

All you need to start playing is someone to play the role of the Universe (the player playing the Universe is hereafter referred to as "Universe") and one or more people to play a set of characters living in the world.

> Note: The Universe is analogous to a Dungeon Master or Game Master. These terms feel a bit antiquated to me, having lived through changes in terminology in the software engineering field. "Universe" is more accurate to the role that a DM/GM fulfills. It's not that they've subjugated something. It's that they inhabit and embody something.

# Attributes

There are three centers of intelligence:
- Body
- Mind
- Social

Each center governs how well a character will interact with their surroundings in the various situations they may come across.

The centers are split into:
- Strength - how well a character can affect the world through that center and 
- Awareness - how well a character can perceive the world through that center.

These centers are derived from the "centers of intelligence" in the [Enneagram](https://www.Enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions). These distinctions of thinking, feeling, and instinct have guided a lot of how characters are differentiated. While strength and awareness are absent from the original Enneagram description, adding them to a role-playing setting gives characters additional depth which would otherwise be missing.

## Attribute descriptions

Playing as the Universe, you will make decisions on how character's attributes interact with their choices. Don't focus on getting it "right" every time. There are many times a character may choose something interpretable in many ways.

- Body Strength: A traditional view of "strength." How much mass a character can move, how much force they can hit with, etc.
- Body Awareness: Agility. How accurately a character can move and contort their body to perform various actions.
- Social Strength: Speech Giving, Persuasion, Bartering. How well a character can communicate thoughts and emotions to another and influence that person's decisions.
- Social Awareness: Empathy, Sympathy, Insight. How well a character can perceive others' intentions, actions, words, and how the character is being perceived.
- Mental Strength: Puzzling, Cartography, Navigation, Deciphering. How well a character can reason about things.
- Mental Awareness: Sensing, Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Researching. How well a character can gather information from the outside world.

## Attribute Shorthand

It can be tedious writing out all characters of each attribute every time they are used. Instead, we combine the first letter of the attribute and the first letter of the dimension.

- Body Strength: BS
- Body Awareness: BA
- Social Strength: SS
- Social Awareness: SA
- Mental Strength: MS
- Mental Awareness: MA

## Using Attributes

There are two major ways to use these attributes.

1. Straight Attribute Roll

This is analogous to the common concept of a "dexterity saving throw." When a situation occurs where characters need to react to something in a straight forward manner, you set the difficulty and ask players to roll OVER the number you set (you don't necessarily have to tell them what the difficulty is). A player rolls that number and adds their attribute to that roll.

Use the [probability tool](https://winstonpuckett.com/products/probability) to determine how likely it is a player will succeed.

2. Skill Roll

> See the Skill section below for a list of skills

There are often times when your players will attempt something with a more nuanced skill set necessary. In these circumstances, you can ask players to make a roll using whatever combination of attributes you prefer.

There are many common skills in games - cooking, sneaking, melee attacks, and ranged attacks for instance which it may be helpful to pre-calculate. These are listed in the skill table below so that your players don't have to do math repetitively.

### Guidelines in using attributes (for Universe beginners)

### Not rolling for things the characters already figure out.

It may be tempting to hand your players a puzzle, then have them roll MS to figure out how to solve it. Sometimes dumb characters make smart moves. If a player finds the answer, they should be allowed to progress the story. Especially if they can find a way for the solution to fit into the character they are playing.

It might also be tempting to have players roll for persuasion. This is more acceptable but needs to be done in the right context. Sometimes your players make a brilliant speech - their characters should be able to say those words. When you roll for social strength, have it be about whether that was the right thing to say to that person. Maybe they made a really intimidating speech, but their character is wearing clothes which don't make it very intimidating coming out of their mouth. Maybe they said something really wise to convince George to stay, but they used the same words George's wife used right before she walked out on him.

In general, these attributes never alter the player's actions for their character - only the outcomes.

### Ask players to roll first before narration

Especially in social settings, having your players roll before their characters speak can give insight into how they should play out the scene. Taking the persuasion example above, instead of trying to explain why a brilliant speech fell on deaf ears, ask the player to roll for persuasion. If they roll low, the player can voluntarily contribute a shoddy speech which falls easily into the narration of the story.

### Not rolling for everything

Make your players roll for things they care about. It may not be a roll to cook for your camp tonight, but if you're in town cooking rations, it might be gripping to roll for how many rations you can make before you'll have to return to town.

Every roll should mean something. Listen to your players for whether this roll will have an impact on their experience at the table.

## Items

Items such as daggers, armor, spy glasses are represented on cards. These cards hold all rules for how to use that item including how many limbs that item takes up, its intended purpose, attribute requirements, etc. 

Your character must meet all requirements in order to use the item effectively. If your character does not meet all requirements, the Universe may decide how the item applies. 

For instance:
- Your character doesn't meet the BA requirements, so the Universe decides that on a failure of 4 or more, your character deals damage to themselves instead of the opponent. 
- Perhaps your character attempts to use two spears at once (which would require four hands). In this case, you have + 1 damage when you hit, but -4 chance to hit.
- Maybe your character attempts to wear two sets of armor at one time. You're asked to role a D20. On anything below 10, the second set of armor is damaged. 10-19, it's simply impossible to get it on. On a 20, you can wear both sets of armor at once, but you have to have the BA necessary or you can't move at all.

Here's an example item:

```
Assassin's Dagger:

Requirements:
- One hand
- BA: 2
- MA: 3

Melee Attack Damage: 1 D12 + 1
Ranged Attack Damage: 2 D8
```

```
Chainmail Armor:

Requirements:
- Covers full body except head, feet, hands.
- BA: 1

AC: +2
Sneak: -2
```

## An aside on classes and races

The first time I played a classless, raceless system I was shocked by how excellent it was to focus on those as storytelling elements instead of elements that effect stats.

In playing Cairn, I was an outlaw named Loop. Because there were no special abilities associated with that background, I focused on playing out the intentions of an outlaw being in a band of people out to rescue the king's son. Upon meeting another rescue party, I tried to rob them while they were sleeping. The adventuring party laughed as I looted dead bodies smelling strongly of vomit. The experience was different for the group *because* I was an outlaw. When I've played rogues in the past, I have tended to stick to lawful good - focusing on skillset. This was a much fuller role-playing experience

In playing Vaeson, I was a fey changeling who was part of a monster hunting group. We hunted all sorts of dark creatures - including the fey. Playing out hiding my identity from the rest of the party and eternally searching for my heritage (my reason to join the hunting group) was incredibly rewarding. I normally play fey/elf/spiritually-in-tune creatures when I play a TTRPG, but this was the first time that my background played into how I interacted with the world. All without a focus on "choosing an elf because it gives me better dexterity."

In both of these scenarios, the class and race drew me further in to playing out the character. Your character should have a rich background. That background should be central to how you play out your character, not a means to a better attribute.

As an aside to this aside, associating races and attributes does not translate well beyond a fantasy world of elves and dwarves. That, however, is a discussion for another day.

You're always free to extend twin-triad to include either classes or species. Make these choices significant to more than attributes and always be respectful of real-world cultures when you do.

## Creating a character

There's nothing needed for character creation

Technically, characters don't even need names to start out. Everyone starts at 0 for their attributes. This enables new players to get a feel for what sort of attributes they use most often. Then when they level, they have more awareness of what happens. 

Because it is immersive to give your characters depth, here are some dimensions you can consider asking of your character or your players:
- Name
- Greatest desire / fear
- Profession
- Background
- Family life / childhood
- Unique characteristics / quirks
- Demeanor
- Height / Weight / Age / Gender
- Species (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Orc, Kobold, Zombie with a dead rat, etc.)
- Purpose in joining up with the party

These dimensions can drive decisions around starting equipment. It is also perfectly acceptable to start with only the clothes on your character's back. Work with your Universe to find out what would be reasonable for your setting.

## Leveling

The Universe chooses when characters level up. Twin-triad does not impose XP or milestone based leveling, believing that the right choice differs per campaign. If this is your first campaign as Universe, I recommend milestone based leveling (characters level up at the end of each session).

When a character levels up, they permanently add 1 to an attribute of their choosing.

# Combat

## Taking a turn

Every character roles for initiative (MA + BA + SA + D20). Players take turns in order of initiative from highest to lowest. In the case of a tie, the side that started the combat goes first. If the tie is on the same side of combat, they may choose who goes first.

Once turn order is set up, each character can move up to their full movement (normally 4 spaces [20 feet]) and take an action. Characters experience 5 seconds per turn regardless of how long the player takes.

### Attacking

Roll `3D6 + attack modifier`. If that number is **over** the target's AC, roll damage.

> Note: 3D6 is shorthand for "three six-sided dice." Likewise, 1D4 = "1 four-sided die."

Damage:
- Unarmed attacks are `1D4 + BS`
- Attacks using an item as intended use the item's damage (Ex: Shooting an arrow from a bow does the bow's damage)
- When a character attacks using an item unconventionally, the Universe decides how the weapon will deal damage. The "Standard Items" table can be used to guide the decision.

### Doing something other than attacking

You are not restricted to attacks. You can also:

- Dodge: Give the first attack against your character disadvantage.
- Dash: Take up to your character's full movement again.
- Stabilize Target: See *Stabilization* below.
- Anything else that your character could do within 5 second.
- Start doing something that will take more than 5 seconds.
- Use magic (See the Magic section below)

## Defending

Characters start at 10 Hit Points (HP). When a character levels, their max HP is calculated as `BS + MS + 10`. In addition to HP, they start with 10 Armor Class (AC) and when they level, it is re-calculated at `BA + SA + 10`. Wearing Armor may increase a player's AC. Take this into consideration during combat.

If an opponent rolls over your AC, they deal damage to your HP. When this happens, note your character's current HP.

> Note: When you are dealt damage which makes you fall at or below 0, write down the actual amount it fell below 0. 

- If your character's HP reaches 0, they are considered "Unconscious." Unconscious characters cannot move or take actions. 
- If their HP reaches -3, the character is considered "Bleeding out." Each round a character is Bleeding out, they lose 1 HP.
- If a character reaches -10 HP, they are considered dead. Dead characters cannot be revived.

These rules mean that it is possible to kill a character in one hit. For instance, if Samantha the Wizard has 2 HP and an opponent deals 12 damage, Samantha the Wizard dies.

### Stabilization

Any conscious character can take an action to stabilize a being that is bleeding out. To do so, the player rolls 3D6. If they roll higher than `7 + Number of Negative hitpoints target has acquired`, the target stops losing hitpoints after every round.

## Resting

Characters may regain HP by resting. To rest, characters need to reasonably believe that they will be safe for the next 8 hours. All players, including the Universe, need to agree that the characters would be able to rest. If all characters choose to rest in an unsafe space and wandering monsters engage the party, every monster gets to take a turn before the players can react.

## Magic

It is improbable that I could give much definition to the magic section without overstepping the world building a Universe desires to do themself. Nevertheless, it may be helpful to have a basic, extensible magic system within the game so that you don't have to implement one from scratch if you don't want to.

Here are the guidelines for magic:
1. Magic just means "knowledge that not everyone has"
1. Because it's "knowledge not everyone has" it's possible that if you lose the item telling you how to do it, you might also lose the ability to perform that magic.
1. Magic is treated like items in that it requires hands, speech, etc. 
1. There may be attribute requirements for invoking magic as well.
1. Invoking a magical ability takes an action like any other. 

Beyond that, the Universe needs to define what spells are available in the world.

# Skills

Skills are common combinations of attributes that would be useful to have around. Below is a list of all skills plus their attribute combinations. Instead of recalculating this, just go to the character maker (TODO) and plug in your character's attributes. 

- Hit points (HP): BS + MS + 10
- Armor Class (AC): BA + SA + 10

- Melee Attacks:
    - Sharp Weapon: BA
    - Blunt Weapon: BS
    - Pole Weapon: (BS + BA) / 2
- Ranged Attack: MS + MA

- Initiative: MA + BA + SA

- Stealth: (BA + MA + SA) / 3
- Persuasion: (SS * 2) + SA
- Intuition: SA

- Lock Picking: MS + MA

- Healing: (BA + MA + (MS * 2)) / 3

- Movement Speed: 4

# FAQ

> I keep seeing 3D6 or 1D12, what does that mean?

Whenever you see a two numbers with a capital D in the middle, it refers to a dice roll. The left number refers to the number of dice and the right number refers to how many sides those dice have.

For instance:
- 3D6 = Three six-sided dice
- 1D12 = One twelve-sided die

If you see only a number on the right, it refers to the number of sides. Writing 1D12 is analogous to a D12.

> How do I switch weapons in combat?

There is no penalty for switching weapons. You can simply declare that you attack with an item in your inventory.

> Do I need to keep track of arrows, ammo, etc?

Most likely not. Ask the Universe.

> Is there a limit to my inventory?

There's nothing in the standard rules about this, but that can be a fun game mechanic if you want to impose it.

> My game includes the supernatural, things like ghosts. How do I make my players roll for sensing those sorts of things?

Note that this is different than standard magic in the game. Standard magic is knowledge most players don't have, and so relies on MS and MA. Occasionally, there is a heavy reliance on interaction with the spiritual world as a narative to the game.

In this situation, there are two options:
1. Because twin-triad is built on the Enneagram and the Enneagram makes little distinction between instinct and body, **a** correct way to do this is by using the Body Awareness attribute.
1. Alternatively, just add an attribute for spirituality with strength and awareness. You could call it Aura for shorthand AS and AA. Role AS for interaction with the spirit world and AA for knowledge/sense of the spirit world.

# Influences

If you like twin-triad, you should check out some of its roots:
- The [Enneagram](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/), which influenced what attributes are part of the system.
- [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/), which inspired the "magic as items" concept.
- [Vaesen](https://www.amazon.com/Vaesen-Nordic-Horror-Roleplaying-Hardback/dp/9189143922) (this is a non-affiliate link to Amazon), which inspired "class and race as story telling elements."
- [Dimension 20](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC8zWIx8aBQme-x1nX9iZ0A), which showed me that a table-top roleplaying game could mean more than battles with monsters.
- [Melee](https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/melee/), which demonstrates really well why 2D6 does not equal 1D12.
- Killing Monsters, which is the first table-top role playing system I played and cultivated my love for TTRPGs. There is no link for it.
