### Magic

Magic is usually central to the mythos of the world itself. It's improbable that I could introduce any standard system without limiting the world building the Universe would want to create. So, the section on magic belongs in the Guideline Tables.

- Focus (FS): MS + 10

In this world, magic is just knowledge most people don't have. That magic is stored in tomes and scrolls accessible to anyone with the right attributes.

When you use a Tome or Scroll, you roll for it like an item. While the magic takes effect

Useage:
- Scrolls are useable only once, but require less attributes.
- Tomes are useable forever as long as the character carries the Tome with them.
- Both Tomes and Scrolls are used as actions.

| Tome of Minor Healing | Make a ranged attack to Heal 1D4 of Target's HP as an action | BA 1, MS 1 | 200 |
| Tome of Conjure Familiar | Conjure a spirit like creature which will do simple tasks for you |
