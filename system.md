# Attributes

There are three centers of intelligence - body, mind, and social. Each center governs how well a character will interact with their surroundings in the various situations they may come across.

The centers are split into:
- "strength" - how well a character can effect the world through that center and 
- "awareness" - how well a character can perceive the world through that center.

## Attribute descriptions

- Body Strength: A traditional view of "strength." How much mass a character can move, how much force they can hit with, etc.
- Body Awareness: Agility. How accurately a character can move and contort their body to perform various actions
- Social Strength: Speech Giving, Pursuassion, Bartering. How well a character can communicate thoughts and emotions to another and influence that person's decisions.
- Social Awareness: Empathy, Sympathy, Insight. How well a character can perceive others' intentions, actions, words, and how the character is being perceived.
- Mental Strength: Puzzling, Cartography, Navigation, Deciphering. How well a character can reason about things.
- Mental Awareness: Sensing, Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Researching. How well a character can gather information from the outside world.

## Attribute Shorthand

It can get tedious writing out all characters of each attribute every time they are used. Instead, we combine the first letter of the attribute and the first letter of the dimension.

- Body Strength: BS
- Body Awareness: BA
- Social Strength: SS
- Social Awareness: SA
- Mental Strength: MS
- Mental Awareness: MA

## Using Attributes

There are two major ways to use these attributes.

1. Straight Attribute Roll

This is analogous to the common concept of a "dexterity saving throw." When a situation occurs where characters need to react to something in a straight forward manner, you set the difficulty and ask players to roll OVER the number you set (you don't necessarily have to tell them what the difficulty is). A player rolls that number and adds their attribute to that roll.

2. Skill Roll

*See the skill table below for a list of skills*

There are often times when your players will attempt something with a more nuanced skill set necessary. In these circumstances, you can ask players to make a roll using whatever combination of attributes you prefer.

There are many common skills in games - cooking, sneaking, melee attacks, and ranged attacks for instance which it may be helpful to pre-calculate. These are listed in the skill table below so that your players don't have to do math repetitively.

## Guidelines in using attributes (for new DMs)

### Not rolling for things the characters already figure out.

It may be tempting to hand your players a puzzle, then have them roll MS to figure out how to solve it. Sometimes dumb characters make smart moves. If a player finds the answer, they should be allowed to progress the story. Especially if they can find a way for the solution to fit into the character they are playing.

It might also be tempting to have players roll for persuassion. This is more acceptable, but needs to be done in the right context. Sometimes your players make a brilliant speech - their characters should be able to say those words. When you roll for social strength, have it be about whether that was the right thing to say to that person. Maybe they made a really intimidating speech, but their character is wearing clothes which don't make it very intimidating coming out of their mouth. Maybe they said something really wise to convince George to stay, but they used the same words George's wife used right before she walked out on him.

In general, these attributes never alter the player's actions for their character - only the outcomes.

### Not rolling for everything

Make your players roll for things they care about. It may not be a roll to cook for your camp tonight, but if you're in town cooking rations, it might be exciting to roll for how many rations you can make before you'll have to return to town.

Every roll should mean something. Listen to your players for whether this roll will have an impact on their experience at the table.

## An aside on classes and races

The first time I played a classless, raceless system I was shocked by how excellent it was to focus on those as story telling elements instead of elements that effect stats.

In playing Cairn, I was an outlaw named Loop. Instead of having special sneaking abilities, I was able to play out the intentions of an outlaw being in a band of people out to rescue the king's son. Upon meeting another rescue party, I attempted to rob them while they were sleeping - something I would never have done if I had been a classic "rogue" class.

In playing Vaeson, I was a fey changling named Chad Chadbourne. I was part of a monster hunting group that hunted all sorts of dark creatures - including the fey. Playing out having to hide my identity from the rest of the party and eternally searching for my heritage (my reason to join the hunting group) was incredibly rewarding.

In both of these scenarios, the class and race drew me further in to playing out the character. Your character should have a rich background. That background should be central to how you play out your character, not a means to a better attribute.

Lastly, associating races and attributes does not translate well beyond a fantasy world of elves and dwarves. That however is a discussion for another day.
